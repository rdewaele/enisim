1. What is enisim?
-----------------
Enisim's goal is to emulate the encryption schemes used by the Enigma family of
rotor machines.

2. Usage.
---------
2.1 Starting up.
----------------
When enisim is started without any commandline options, it will run in its
interactive mode. Follow the instructions that appear on the screen.

-!- Not yet implemented -!-
Over time, enisim will also have a non-interactive mode. This feature is on
the todo list.

2.2 Getting help.
-----------------
enisim --help should tell you everything about the enisim options.
The list shown by the help function will always be up to date, whereas
this read-me file might limp a little bit behind.

Currently enisim supports configuring the following properties through
command-line options (default in brackets):

The other switches are for:
	- help (-?, --help);
	- usage (--usage);
	- version and copyright information (-v, --version).
